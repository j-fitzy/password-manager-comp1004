this is a password manager capable of submiting website names, usernames and passwords
to an easy to read table, through direct input or the uploading of a JSON file with correct formating. 

it also contains a password Strength calculator built into the manual password submission box with text pop ups to inform you of their strength. 
these passwords follow the criteria of:

weak = any password regardless of special character or numbers that contain less than 8 letters 
medium = any password greater than 8 letters and less than 10 letters with atleast 1 special character or at least 1 number and passwords that contain both a special character and a number with less than 10 letters
strong = any password containing atleast 10 letters and both a number and a special character

after submitting your passwords to the table there is also an option to download all the data in your table into a well formated JSON file that is both easy to read and reuploadable at any point.
